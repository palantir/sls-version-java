  description: '`SlsVersionMatcher#safeValueOf` now allocates 94% less memory per
    invocation, by avoiding throwing and catching a `NumberFormatException`. Specifically,
    it would allocate ~2192 bytes for every single invocation in my benchmark, and
    now it allocates 152 bytes per op. It''s also ~10x faster.'
